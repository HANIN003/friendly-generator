# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description
This repo was made to create a password generator with input from the user on which characters to include. When the user clicks on the generate password button, they will get a series of prompts asking for different inputs for the password. First prompt is length, followed by options for lower-case letters, upper-case letters, numbers, and finally special characters.
Once the user finishes with the selections the generator will show the corresponding password in the display window.
